# Micro:bit Robot Obstacle Avoidance

This project provides JavaScript code for a Micro:bit robot programmed to navigate around obstacles while moving at an optimized speed.

## Description

The provided JavaScript code is designed to run on a Micro:bit robot equipped with distance sensors. It utilizes adjusted obstacle detection thresholds and optimized motor speeds to sensitively navigate around walls while maintaining stability and speed.

## Features

- Sensitively detects obstacles within a range of 5cm to 20cm.
- Optimized motor speeds for faster movement and stability.
- Smooth turning behavior for effective obstacle avoidance.
- Moves straight for a short distance after turning to ensure clearance from obstacles.

## Usage

1. Load the provided JavaScript code onto your Micro:bit robot using MakeCode.
2. Ensure the robot is equipped with distance sensors compatible with the code.
3. Power on the robot and observe its behavior as it navigates around obstacles with improved sensitivity and speed.

## Requirements

- Micro:bit robot with MakeCode support
- Distance sensors compatible with Micro:bit
